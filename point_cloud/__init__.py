"""
Root package for the point_cloud project.

This file makes the ``point_cloud`` directory a Python package.  It
previously contained a collection of procedural scripts for working
with point clouds.  The project is being migrated to Temporal for
orchestration; see the ``point_cloud.temporal`` subpackage for the new
pipeline implementation.
